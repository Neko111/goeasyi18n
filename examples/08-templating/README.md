# Go Easy i18n - Templating example

The templating feature allows you to use the i18n instance in your `text/template` and `html/template` templates with ease ðŸ”¥.

This is really useful if you want to use the i18n instance in your web application that uses `html/template` templates.

## The example

This example is divided in 2 files:

- [main.go](main.go): Here is the code of the templating example.

- [i18n.go](i18n.go): Here is the code of the i18n instance (If you read the other examples you should be familiar with this).

Just run the program using `go run .` and you will see the output of the example.

Feel free to play with the code and explore the example.
